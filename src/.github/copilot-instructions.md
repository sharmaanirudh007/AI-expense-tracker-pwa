This project is a JavaScript PWA for an AI-powered expense tracker. It uses Vite as the build tool and will include:

-   Service worker for offline support
-   IndexedDB for local storage
-   Google Drive API for sync
-   Gemini API for AI features
-   No central backend except Google Drive and Gemini

Copilot should generate code that is modular, modern, and PWA-compliant.
